To successfully implement the cross-platform recommendation system as outlined, you will need to follow a series of detailed steps. Below, I break down each component of the system, providing explanations and actionable tasks to help you build the backend effectively.

### Step 1: Set Up Your Development Environment

1. **Install Required Software**:
   - **Python**: Ensure you have Python 3.10 or later installed.
   - **Docker**: Install Docker to containerize your application.
   - **Git**: Use Git for version control and collaboration.
   - **IDE/Text Editor**: Use an IDE like PyCharm, VSCode, or any text editor you prefer.

2. **Create a Project Directory**:
   ```bash
   mkdir prime_recommender
   cd prime_recommender
   ```

3. **Set Up a Virtual Environment**:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

4. **Install FastAPI and Other Dependencies**:
   Create a `requirements.txt` file with the following content:
   ```
   fastapi
   uvicorn
   pandas
   boto3  # For AWS SDK
   ```

   Then install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Step 2: Build the Recommendation Model

1. **Implement the Recommendation Logic**:
   - Create a file named `recommender.py` where you will define your `HybridRecommenderV3` class.
   - This class should include methods for loading data, processing user profiles, and generating recommendations based on user activity.

   Example structure:
   ```python
   import pandas as pd

   class HybridRecommenderV3:
       def __init__(self, data_paths, artifacts_path):
           self.data_paths = data_paths
           self.artifacts_path = artifacts_path
           self.load_data()

       def load_data(self):
           # Load user, movie, and ratings data
           self.users = pd.read_csv(self.data_paths['users'])
           self.movies = pd.read_csv(self.data_paths['movies'])
           self.ratings = pd.read_csv(self.data_paths['ratings'])

       def get_recommendations(self, user_id, top_n):
           # Implement your recommendation logic here
           # Return a DataFrame with recommended items
           pass
   ```

### Step 3: Create the FastAPI Application

1. **Define the API Endpoints**:
   - In `app/main.py`, set up the FastAPI application and define the `/recommend` endpoint as shown in the previous response.

2. **Handle User Requests**:
   - Ensure that the endpoint processes incoming requests, retrieves user profiles, and generates recommendations.

### Step 4: Dockerize the Application

1. **Create a Dockerfile**:
   - In the root of your project directory, create a `Dockerfile` as shown previously. This file will define how to build your Docker image.

2. **Build the Docker Image**:
   ```bash
   docker build -t prime-recommender:latest .
   ```

3. **Run the Docker Container**:
   ```bash
   docker run -d -p 8000:8000 prime-recommender:latest
   ```

   You can now access your API at `http://localhost:8000/recommend`.

### Step 5: Ingest Multi-Surface Signals

1. **Capture User Actions**:
   - Implement a mechanism to capture user actions across different platforms. This could be done using AWS Lambda functions or a dedicated microservice that listens for events.

2. **Tag Events**:
   - Ensure that each event is tagged with `platform_type` and `content_type` when ingested.

3. **Emit to a Queue**:
   - Use a message queue like Amazon Kinesis or Kafka to handle the ingestion of user actions.

### Step 6: Build the Feature Store

1. **Set Up AWS Feature Store**:
   - Use AWS SageMaker Feature Store or DynamoDB to store user engagement vectors.
   - Create a schema that includes user engagement metrics from all platforms.

2. **Implement Glue/Spark Jobs**:
   - Write jobs that periodically read from the queue and update the Feature Store with the latest user engagement data.

### Step 7: Integrate Feature Store with the Model

1. **Load User Profiles**:
   - In your FastAPI application, implement a function to load user profiles from the Feature Store when a recommendation request is made.

   Example:
   ```python
   def load_user_profile(user_id: int) -> dict:
       client = boto3.client('sagemaker-featurestore-runtime')
       record = client.get_record(
           FeatureGroupName='prime_user_profile',
           RecordIdentifierValueAsString=str(user_id)
       )
       return {f['FeatureName']: f['ValueAsString'] for f in record['Record']}
   ```

2. **Update the Model with User Engagement**:
   - Before generating recommendations, update the model with the latest user engagement data.

### Step 8: Deploy the Application

1. **Choose a Deployment Method**:
   - Decide whether to deploy on AWS ECS, EKS, Lambda, or App Runner based on your needs.

2. **Set Up CI/CD**:
   - Use GitHub Actions or another CI/CD tool to automate the build and deployment process.

### Step 9: Frontend Integration

1. **Connect Frontend to API**:
   - Ensure that your frontend (built with Cursor or any other framework) can make HTTP requests to your FastAPI backend.

2. **Handle CORS and Authentication**:
   - Configure CORS in your FastAPI application to allow requests from your frontend.
   - Implement authentication using AWS Cognito or JWT to secure your API.

### Step 10: Testing and Monitoring

1. **Test the API**:
   - Use tools like Postman or curl to test your API endpoints and ensure they return the expected results.

2. **Monitor Performance**:
   - Set up logging and monitoring (e.g., using AWS CloudWatch) to track the performance of your application and identify any issues.

### Summary

By following these detailed steps, you will be able to build a robust, cross-platform recommendation system that integrates seamlessly with various Amazon services. Each step is designed to ensure that you understand the underlying processes and can troubleshoot any issues that arise during development.
